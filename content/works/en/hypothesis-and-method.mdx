# Hypothesis and Method

What is the driving force of history? Is it materialistic or idealistic? The materialistic view of history posits that the mode of material production determines the social structure. In contrast, the idealistic view of history considers human spirit, thought, and ideology as the driving forces that propel history.

However, from the standpoint of (metaphysical) materialism, which regards everything as fundamentally a physical phenomenon, humans themselves, who generate ideas, are also physical beings. Therefore, the materialistic and idealistic aspects are not necessarily mutually exclusive but can be viewed as interconnected. It is natural to think that history indivisibly encompasses both materialistic and idealistic aspects. If so, the question arises: by what physical principles do powerful ideas that move history, particularly the "values" that direct our actions, emerge?

Looking back at the history of thought, the understanding of value has undergone significant changes. In ancient and medieval times, the values of Truth, Goodness, and Beauty were grasped integrally. However, with the advent of modernity, these domains became differentiated and pluralized, and in contemporary times, they exhibit relativistic aspects. Considering this transition, the question of whether "value" is universal or merely relative resurfaces.

This essay posits that value possesses both universality and relativity. Universality here does not refer to Platonic transcendent reality. Rather, it means that there exists an a priori form that makes all value judgments possible. On the other hand, actual value judgments are always made by a knowing subject with a specific perspective. More fundamentally, it is the knowing subject with a specific perspective, i.e., the "existent" itself, that recognizes and judges value. Therefore, if we explore the principles that make existents exist and living beings live, we should find there the a priori form underlying all values. This value form, according to the hypothesis of this essay, is none other than Truth, Goodness, and Beauty.

However, we cannot directly perceive the principle of existence itself. As Kant showed, our cognition is limited to the realm of experience, and matters beyond experience, the thing-in-itself, are in principle unknowable. Ultimately, "knowing the facts" is inseparable from the state of belief where the knowing subject "believes the facts to be so." If this is the case, "principle" should perhaps be understood not as an objective reality, but rather as an a priori postulate or speculative intuition that enables us to axiomatically construct a coherent belief system about the world.

Therefore, this essay does not start from that unattainable principle or speculative intuition itself, but rather begins by clearly describing and analyzing the "belief system" we currently hold. In particular, it focuses on the structure indicated by the belief that we possess a belief system in the first place—that is, the meta-level belief system. Specifically, it takes as its starting point the formal description of how our perception and cognition construct the world and give rise to value emergence.

Through this method, this essay aims to approach the roots of the duality of value and the dynamic principles of history. And we must not forget the fact that the object of our direct experience is not the dynamic principle of history itself, but always ideas. Therefore, the idealistic perspective centered on ideas is extremely practical, and it is precisely an idealism accompanied by an understanding of the dynamic principles underlying the emergence of those ideas—that is, the materialistic aspect—that achieves a more certain practicality.
