# Value Emergence System

This project appears to be a web application focused on explaining and showcasing concepts related to "Value Emergence". It likely utilizes Next.js for the frontend framework, TypeScript for type safety, and Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui for styling.

Key features seem to include:
*   Displaying conceptual information, potentially using Markdown (MDX).
*   Showcasing related "Works" (like research papers or projects) using a carousel.
*   Visual elements, possibly including simulations like a cellular automaton background, to illustrate emergent phenomena.
*   Support for multiple languages.
